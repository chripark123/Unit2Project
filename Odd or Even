Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd
number react differently when divided by 2?
Extras:
1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one
number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the
user. If not, print a different appropriate message.


number = input("Please enter a number = ")
if int(number) % 2 == 0 :
  print(str(number) + " is an Even Number")
else:
  print(str(number) + " is an Odd Number")
if int(number) % 4 ==0 :
  print(str(number) + " is a multiple of 4")

num = input("Please enter a number to check = ")
check = input("Please enter a number to divide by = ")
if int(num) % int(check) == 0 :
  print(str(num) + " divides evenly into " + str(check))
else:
  print(str(num) + " does not divide evenly into " + str(check));
